            Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing strategy where businesses collaborate with affiliates to promote their products or services. Affiliates earn a commission for each sale or action generated through their promotional efforts. It offers
            a win-win situation for both businesses and affiliates, as businesses can expand their reach and drive sales through the affiliate network, while affiliates can monetize their online presence and earn passive income. With affiliate marketing,
            businesses can leverage the influence and reach of affiliates to tap into new markets, increase brand exposure, and drive targeted traffic. It provides a cost-effective way to reach a wider audience and achieve business growth through mutually
            beneficial partnerships. By tracking and optimizing affiliate performance, businesses can maximize their ROI and build long-term relationships with successful affiliates.
